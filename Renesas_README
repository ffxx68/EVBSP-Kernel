How to build the kernel for the Renesas EV platform

1) Set your host cross-compiler chain. E.g.

export CROSS_COMPILER=arm-eabi-

2) Set the architecture to ARM:

export ARCH=arm

3) A pre-configured .config is found, but if you wish to change your setting, either use a .config derived from a target device, or change the one found here using 'make menuconfig' or other standard Kernel confiugraiotn tools.

4) Clean, then recompile the kernel:

make clean
make
